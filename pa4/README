List.c
Implements a doubly linked list from a list data structure. The list uses
the cursor node to store the number of lines from Lex. The node struct is
defined in this file.

List.h
This is the header file and defines all the List operations being 
performed on the list.

Graph.c
This contatins the Graph functions and implements BFS to search the graph 
structure

Graph.h
This is the header file that defines all the graph operations being 
performed on the graph.

GraphTest.c
This a test file to test out my List ADT and Graph ADT to see if the 
operations are fully functional.

FindPath.c
This file has the main function and calls the Graph operations to 
calculate the shortest path and the distance. 

Makefile
Creates an executable file for FindPath. Compiles files.
