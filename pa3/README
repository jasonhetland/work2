List.java
A list implements a double linked list. Uses cursor node to iterate 
through the list. The list has entry objects that are in the matrix.

Matrix.java
Contains all the matrix operations. Implemented using an arrary of list 
objects instead of ints like the last pa. It uses an entry class for the 
entries of the matrix.

Sparse.java
Main program. Takes input and output filenames and outputs the result of 
the matrices performing operations on them.

MatrixTest.java
Altered MatrixClient,java and added some of my own operations to test if 
they worked on the matrix.

ListTest.java
A test file to test operations of the list. While building the ADT I 
tested the operations in this file. 

Makefile
Builds an executable jar file. Helps compiling
